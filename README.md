A data-driven regression modeling project aimed at predicting the salary of newly hired employees at TechWorks Consulting, a leading IT staffing firm. The project uses historical employee data, accounting for educational background, experience, previous compensation, job role, and location to estimate fair and competitive salary offers.

Project Description
* Performed end-to-end data preprocessing, including handling missing values, outliers, and incorrect data formats.
* Converted categorical features such as College (Tier1, Tier2, Tier3), City (Metro vs Non-Metro), and Role (Executive, Manager) into numerical representations, using label encoding and one-hot encoding where appropriate.
* Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and feature correlations with the target variable CTC.
* Scaled numerical features using normalization techniques to standardize feature ranges and improve model performance.
* Trained multiple regression models including Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor.
* Compared model performance using evaluation metrics like RÂ² Score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
* Identified the best-performing model based on accuracy and generalization capability, and explained the rationale behind model selection.
* Discussed potential improvements such as hyperparameter tuning, ensemble techniques, and advanced feature engineering for better performance.
